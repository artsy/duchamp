# duchamp

Reusable GitHub Actions and Danger.js plugins for the Artsy organization. This repository provides a centralized collection of workflows and tooling to maintain consistency and quality across Artsy's repositories.

## üéØ Purpose

Duchamp provides shared GitHub Actions and Danger.js configurations that help enforce best practices across Artsy repositories, including:

- **Automated version labeling** for pull requests
- **Dependency management** checks via Danger
- **Standardized CI/CD workflows** for Node.js projects
- **Conventional commits** validation

## üèó Architecture

This repository serves as a tooling hub that other Artsy repositories can reference. It contains:

- **Reusable GitHub Actions**: Workflows that can be called by other repositories
- **Danger.js plugins**: Automated PR checking and labeling
- **Shared configuration**: Common setup patterns for Node.js projects

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using the Actions in Your Repository

To use duchamp's actions in your repository, reference them in your workflow files:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/danger.yml
name: Danger Checks
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  danger:
    uses: artsy/duchamp/.github/workflows/run-danger.yml@main
    secrets:
      danger-token: ${{ secrets.DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN }}
```

### Available Actions

| Action | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `run-danger.yml` | General Danger.js checks | For custom danger configurations |
| `run-danger-yarn.yml` | Yarn-specific Danger checks | For Node.js projects using Yarn |
| `run-add-version-label.yml` | Auto-add version labels to PRs | For repositories using auto-release |
| `run-conventional-commits-check.yml` | Validate conventional commits | For conventional commit compliance |
